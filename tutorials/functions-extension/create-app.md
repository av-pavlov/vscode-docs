# Create your local Function App

First, create a local Azure Functions application. An Azure Functions app can contain many Functions with various triggers - this tutorial focuses on HTTP triggers, which allow you to handle to incoming HTTP traffic.

In VS Code, expand the **AZURE FUNCTIONS** explorer and click the **Create Project** icon.

Choose an empty directory for the app then select JavaScript for the language of your Functions App.

VS Code will reload and your new local Functions app will be loaded into your workspace.

Next, add an HTTP trigger Function to your app.
